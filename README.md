## Inspiration
In our always-on digital world, everyone—from students juggling tabs to professionals toggling between apps—feels the strain of nonstop screen time. We asked peers what they wished they had at the peak of their digital fatigue, and the answer was universal: a gentle reminder to simply breathe. By reclaiming those missing moments between notifications, **Pause** aims to transform tiny breaks into mindful resets.


## What It Does
**Pause** is a cross-platform app and browser extension that delivers 5–15 second micro-pauses—visual or audio cues reminding you to take a breath and reset your focus. There’s no tracking, no gamification, no pressure: just calming animations, brief quotes, or ambient sounds that fade in and out as unobtrusively as a sigh.

## What's Next for Pause
- **Mood detection**: Use webcam-based stress cues to adapt pause frequency.
- **Environment sync**: Auto-switch themes based on time of day or season.
- **Collaborative pauses**: Friends can share micro-breaks in real time—because presence is more powerful together.
